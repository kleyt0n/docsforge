"""MkDocs hook that builds the rustdoc API reference into the site.

Registered as ``hooks:`` in ``mkdocs.yml``. On every build it runs
``cargo doc --no-deps`` for the crate in ``rust/`` (skipped when no crate
source changed since the last run), stages the output under ``rust/target/``,
and appends the files to the MkDocs build — so the Rust API reference is part
of the site in ``mkdocs serve``, ``mkdocs build``, and CI alike.

Because the files join the build before pages render, links to them validate
under ``mkdocs build --strict`` like links to any other page. Delete this file
and the ``hooks:`` block alongside ``rust/`` for a non-Rust project.
